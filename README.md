Implement V5 ATM implementation 
  ▸FSM = Finite State Machine 
▸Goal: make it possible to have multiple ATM implementations for separate ATM machines. 
▸Clients should be able to request an ATM be created without having to depend on which ATM implementation is created 
▸Client  ATM atm = getNewATM();   // Implementation could decide to return different FSM without breaking client 
▸Code should focus only on portion of implementation relevant to ATM creation and ATM state management 
▸Deliverables:  
  ▸Sketch of V6 ATM implementation
